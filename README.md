## Topics Covered

* Multithreading and data-parallel workloads
* Concurrency with locks and channels
* Low-level memory performance and cache optimization
* Profiling and benchmarking (`perf`, flamegraphs)
* Safe systems programming in Rust

## Build and Run

Each project uses Cargo:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

Some may require test flags or profiling tools. Check each folderâ€™s README for details.
