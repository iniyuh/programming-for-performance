# ece459-1241-practice-lifetime

This is the repo for the lifetime question (W23 q4b)

Here is the question:

> Consider the short program. This won't compile. Add lifetime annotations to make it compile. As it says in the comment, you may not remove the `'static` annotation on `rv`, nor may you change the signature of function `g()`. Also, you may not add `'static` anywhere. I really don't know how you might use `unsafe` here, but don't do that.

Have fun!
