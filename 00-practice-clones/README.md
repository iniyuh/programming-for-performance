# ece459-1241-practice-clones

This is the repo for the removing clones question (W23 q4a)

Here is the question:

> Your task here is to remove the calls to `.clone()`. The Rust Programming Language says that it's OK, as a beginning Rust programmer, to use `clone()` here just to get things working, but you can indeed rewrite this code to not use `clone()` while still populating the struct `S` with the args. You may not rewrite the struct `S`. You may not use `unsafe`.

A pipeline is configured to assess your changes and provide feedback

Note that the pipeline always succeeds so you need to look into its log to see the feedback.

Have fun!
